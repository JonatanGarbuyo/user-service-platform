# ADR-0012: Serve the administration SPA from the Worker origin under /admin

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

Ticket #124 delivers the first usable administration increment (spec #123):
an operator signs in with an existing verified administrative User, sees
their real administrative identity, reloads without losing the session, and
signs out. The UI is a client-only React + TypeScript + Vite application
built on Marmelab Shadcn Admin Kit (`shadcn-admin-kit`, ra-core) with
Tailwind styling, reusing the existing `POST /v1/auth/login`,
`POST /v1/auth/sign-out` and HttpOnly cookie session plus a new
`GET /v1/admin/me` application-owned contract.

Authentication travels in HttpOnly cookies, so the SPA must share the
Worker origin: any cross-origin split would require a second cookie domain
and CORS credential plumbing for no product benefit. No production Node
server, SSR requirement, new external service or database is included.

## Decision

Serve the built client-only SPA under `/admin` on the existing Worker
origin through Workers Static Assets:

- The frontend builds to `admin/dist` (`npm run build:admin`). The base
  `wrangler.jsonc` and every materialized target-specific Wrangler config
  (ticket #78) reference the same built-assets directory, so local,
  sandbox and production serve identical assets.
- The Worker owns routing precedence: `/v1/*` JSON operations (including
  the generated OpenAPI document and RFC 9457 Problem Details not-found
  behavior) and the service-owned `/auth-actions/*` browser pages keep
  their existing behavior. Unknown `/v1` routes remain JSON Problem
  Details, never SPA HTML.
- `/admin` and `/admin/*` resolve through the `ASSETS` binding; asset
  misses under `/admin` fall back to `/admin/index.html` so the sign-in
  deep link and authenticated views survive refresh. The fallback applies
  only under `/admin`.
- Local development proxies same-origin API requests to the local Worker
  (`admin/vite.config.ts` dev proxy); the production topology has no
  proxy and no Node server.
- The UI never stores an authentication token in browser storage, never
  parses session cookies, and never infers authorization from frontend
  state: `GET /v1/admin/me` (401 anonymous, 403 verified non-administrator)
  is the single authorization signal behind the `authProvider`.
- Frontend dependencies are pinned in the `admin` npm workspace with
  recorded provenance (`admin/README.md`); copied kit components, if any,
  stay under repository maintenance. Frontend lint, typecheck and the
  production build run in the deterministic repository gates; the deploy
  orchestration rebuilds the assets before materializing the target
  config. No live provisioning, secret or production promotion is part of
  this decision.

## Consequences

- Same-origin HttpOnly cookies keep working for browser navigation,
  reload and sign-out without credential-mode configuration.
- API observability and error contracts are unchanged: SPA fallback cannot
  conceal API failures because it never applies outside `/admin`.
- `admin/dist` is build output and stays uncommitted; environments without
  a prior build serve JSON Problem Details for `/admin` instead of
  crashing, and the deploy preflight fails closed when assets are missing.
- Future list/detail slices reuse this topology and add parameterized
  administrative routes; request telemetry must then log matched route
  patterns rather than raw identifiers (ADR-0009).

## Deferred

- Per-PR deployed Cloudflare preview infrastructure.
- A generated TypeScript API client consumed by the SPA (frontend types
  reuse the published OpenAPI shapes where practical; full SDK packaging
  remains deferred per ADR-0007).
